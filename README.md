# MCA-Project
This project aims to develop an AI-powered diagnostic system that automatically detects vitamin deficiencies (A, B, C, D, and E) based on image inputs, such as facial or skin features. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and neural network algorithms, the system offers fast, reliable, and non-invasive health assessments.
